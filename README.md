# Muvipedia
Android movie info browsing app version 2, presents content from TheMovieDb.org

## History
This application was submitted by Muhammad Ansharullah (ansorkazama@gmail.com) as the project:<b>Popular Movies-Phase 2</b> to compete the requirements of the Associate Android Developer Fast Track Nanodegree Program course.

## Building this application with Android Studio - prerequisite

<b>You will need an API key from TheMovieDB.org.  For this app, add your key to your grade.properties file:</b>

    /Users/Myname/.gradle/gradle.properties

with this identifier (edit in your key between the quotes):

     TheMovieDbApiToken="12341234123412341234"

## Criteria

The app spesification checks off the following requirements that were demanded by the Udacity Review teams:

**Common Project Requirements**
- [X] App is written solely in the Java Programming Language.
- [X] App conforms to common standards found in the [Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines](http://udacity.github.io/android-nanodegree-guidelines/core.html)

**User Interface - Layout**

- [X] UI contains an element (e.g., a spinner or settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: **most popular, highest rated, and favorites**
- [X] Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails
- [X] UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie
- [X] Movie Details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.
- [X] Movie Details layout contains a section for displaying trailer videos and user reviews

**User Interface - Function**
- [X] When a user changes the sort criteria (**most popular, highest rated, and favorites**) the main view gets updated correctly.
- [X] When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched [Phone] or displayed in a fragment [Tablet]
- [X] When a trailer is selected, app uses an Intent to launch the trailer
- [X] In the movies detail screen, a user can tap a button(for example, a star) to mark it as a Favorite

**Network API Implementation**
- [X] In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.
- [X] App requests for related videos for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/videos endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.
- [X] App requests for user reviews for a selected movie via the /movie/{id}/reviews endpoint in a background thread and displays those details when the user selects a movie.

**Data Persistence**
- [X] The titles and ids of the user's favorite movies are stored in a **ContentProvider** backed by a SQLite database. This **ContentProvider** is updated whenever the user favorites or unfavorites a movie.
- [X] When the "favorites" setting option is selected, the main view displays the entire favorites collection based on movie ids stored in the **ContentProvider**.


#### Extended Criteria

**ContentProvider**
- [X] Extend the favorites **ContentProvider** to store the movie poster, synopsis, user rating, and release date, and display them even when offline.
- [X] Implement sharing functionality to allow the user to share the first trailerâ€™s **YouTube** URL from the movie details screen.
